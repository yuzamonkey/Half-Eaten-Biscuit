## Do ❌
- Testing in deployment pipeline on GitHub
- Remove hover-effects in mobile view
- Refreshing profiles-page gives error


## Done ✅
- Figure out a way for routes to be active when refreshing on published site. Now refresh makes navlinks not active and clicking them messes up the relative url path
  - **Solution:** Go with '/' for relative paths to domain instead of './'
- Sideways scroll on jobmarket options on mobile
