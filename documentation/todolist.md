# Todolist/bugs

## Do ⏺ (5.9.2021)
- REMEMBER TO UPDATE ROUTES!
- Favicon
- Jobmarket
  - Filters
  - My ads
- Messaging
  - Mobile bug whe creating new conversations (shows conversation select after routing to conversation)
  - Delete conversation
- Settings
  - Edit username/password
  - Edit profile
  - (Change activity)
- Fix notifications

## Fix ❌
- Notifications not working correctly
- Testing in deployment pipeline on GitHub
- Remove hover-effects in mobile view

## Fixed ✅
- Figure out a way for routes to be active when refreshing on published site. Now refresh makes navlinks not active and clicking them messes up the relative url path
  - **Solution:** Go with '/' for relative paths to domain instead of './'
- Sideways scroll on jobmarket options on mobile
- Handling too large images
