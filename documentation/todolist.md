## Do ⏺
- REMEMBER TO UPDATE ROUTES!

## Fix ❌
- Testing in deployment pipeline on GitHub
- Remove hover-effects in mobile view
- Clicking on notification 2 things:
  - Jobpost does not change if url changes
  - Does not show jobinfo if currently in jobmarket

## Fixed ✅
- Figure out a way for routes to be active when refreshing on published site. Now refresh makes navlinks not active and clicking them messes up the relative url path
  - **Solution:** Go with '/' for relative paths to domain instead of './'
- Sideways scroll on jobmarket options on mobile
- Handling too large images
