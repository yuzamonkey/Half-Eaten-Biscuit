## Do ⏺
What have not been initialized:
  - Profiles

## Fix ❌
- Testing in deployment pipeline on GitHub
- Remove hover-effects in mobile view
- (fixed?) Refreshing profiles-page and messages gives error. Might be express issue

## Fixed ✅
- Figure out a way for routes to be active when refreshing on published site. Now refresh makes navlinks not active and clicking them messes up the relative url path
  - **Solution:** Go with '/' for relative paths to domain instead of './'
- Sideways scroll on jobmarket options on mobile
